    <b> <font size="+2"> Tamper Monkey Click Less </font></b> <br/>
    The Tampermonkey “Click Less” was a project inspired by an Amazon Software Developement II located in Vancouver that created a JavaScript script file that changed the behavior of one of the Trouble Ticket websites that my department commonly uses. Essentially, he made it more obvious/intuitive and reduced the workload of clicks for a repeated task.This inspired me to create similar functionality in several other sites that are commonly accessed, reducing clicks, reducing errors, and reducing risk of injury from repeated motions. Redundancy is for automation.

    <b> <font size="+2"> Options and their Normal Distribution </font></b> <br/>
    300 years, several generations of genius, and the early discovery of Brownian Motion culminated in a Nobel-Prize winning equation that explained, mathematically, the influences of factors contributing to the pricing of equity options: The Black-Scholes Equation. 
    </br>
    Leveraging statistics and the probability of an “iron condor” multi-leg option strategy passing through a profitability point according to this normal distribution, I was able to isolate a trading strategy that allowed for consistent gains while limiting risk to a quantifiable acceptance.Now the fun part, integrating with a brokers API, I simplify the implementation down to a single click and let JavaScript do the work.

    <b> <font size="+2"> The Witch Hunt </font></b> <br/>
    A project I unapologetically call the Witch Hunt, this mess came about as a result of my concerns about a lack of accountability. While voicing these concerns to a senior ops manager and explaining the impact on customers as well as labor losses to track down and correct issues without having a method to provide feedback necessary to isolate the cause or correct behaviors, I found myself called out.
    </br>
    I was asked what I would propose as a solution and if I’d have the ability to implement my proposed solution… and here we are. Again I turn to Tampermonkey to leverage JavaScript to search for correlations in a database to track “touches” that turn into “troubles” in an effort to show inbound departmental issues that affect our ability to process outbound fulfillment.

    <b> <font size="+2"> Fractal Gears and Clockwork Pain </font></b> <br/>
    Near and dear to my heart. I’ve spent around four hours trying to get this image to go back into the semi-transparent header of this document. I’ve done all conceivable combinations of words, periods, slashes, and both single and double quotes in order to get it to path correctly from the images folder to the background-image field. I searched through no less than four sites with no fix. Now I am forced to reach out to mentors. It’s a monumental pain.
