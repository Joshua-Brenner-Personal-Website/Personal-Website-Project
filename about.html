        A late bloomer, once I found my path (dream, really) I held strong. I continue to find opportunities for growth and learning. As a new employee to Amazon, I took the challenge of being trained in many positions to heart; obtaining certifications and permissions for over a dozen positions and growing.

        College has been another excellent situation to find what is best suited for my talents. I have gone through classes for majors such as finance, business, physics, math, accounting (I even went through the HVAC program) only to find that little was a good fit until I happened on a new program at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) called D.A.S.E. Short for Data Analytics and Systems Engineering, it is a hybrid program of data analysis and computer science. This is the concotion I was born to drink.

        Now, relentlessly in pursuit of my desired degree and focused on obtaining the technical skills that align with my mindset, I look forward to a time when my creativity has a coding outlet and my strong soft-skills are complemented by skills in software.
